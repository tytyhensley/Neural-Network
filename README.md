# Neural-Network
## Introduction
Artificial neural networks (NN) or connectionist systems are computing systems vaguely
inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. The neural network
itself is not an algorithm, but rather a framework for many different machine learning
algorithms to work together and process complex data inputs. Such systems “learn” to
perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any
task-specific rules. For example, in image recognition, they might learn to identify images
that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manually labeled as “cat” or
“no cat” and using the results to identify cats in other images. They do this without any prior
knowledge about cats, for example, that they have fur, tails, whiskers and cat- like faces.
Instead, they automatically generate identifying characteristics from the learning material
that they process.
## Dataset
The MNIST database of handwritten digits, available from this page, has a training set of
60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available
from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image. It is a
good database for people who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition
methods on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting.
